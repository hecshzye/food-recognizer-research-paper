# food-recognizer-research-paper
#### Food recognition model using convolutional neural network &amp; computer vision. The goal is to match or beat the DeepFood Research Paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05675

Dataset used in this model is food101 dataset from Tensorflow datasets.

Using **Mixed Pricision** and **TESLA T4 GPU** to achieve maximum accuracy without overfitting or excess time consumption during the training.
